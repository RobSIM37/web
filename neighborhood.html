                <h2>The small city with a big city attitude.</h2>
                
                <p> Wyandotte, named for the indigenous Wyandot tribe of the Huron nation, who lived in the area, is the hometown of my mother, her parents, and her nine siblings, no matter how far away they live. It will always hold a special place in my heart, not only for the familial connection but because of the strange and charming attitude its citizens display. Wyandotte is a small city with a big city attitude.</p>
    
                <p>In terms of population, Wyandotte is ranked 81st in the state. By area, it only ranks 121st. It doesn’t seem to have a legitimate claim to being a big city. Certainly not one that would be known to people living elsewhere around the world, such as Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor, or Grand Rapids. It is, in large part, comprised of sleepy residential neighborhoods, where families enjoy a suburban life. It is dotted with parks and playgrounds where children play during the temperate times in Michigan (April to October). The crown jewel of Wyandotte is Bishop Park, which stretches a significant portion of the city’s waterfront boarder with the Detroit River. Its idyllic setting provides a lovely place to take a walk, picnic, grilling, birthday parties, and family gatherings. Even the thriving downtown district, one blocks walk from Bishop Park gives the impression of a city too small to be noticed by “big box retailers.” In truth, this is an intentionally cultivated image, and the citizens are simply not interested in trading their city’s unique character for “one-stop-shopping.”</p>
    
                <p>That intentionally cultivated image and unique character is most clearly made manifest by one of Wyandotte’s most interesting landmarks. At the north end of Bishop Park sits “Wyandotte Municipal Services”, a publicly controlled utility company that provides electricity, water, cable tv, and internet access to the citizens of Wyandotte. While it seems unfathomable that a city of its size would have need of such services (when cheaper alternatives could be found), those who use the services will tout the quality of the product, citing the old adage, “You get what you pay for.” Certainly, the confined scope of the municipal services make it more responsive to emergency situation, such as power outages. Where other cities often struggle to recover from the frequent summer storms, waiting on the large private electrical utility company DTE to reconnect their power, the dedicated technicians at Wyandotte Municipal, focusing singularly on their city, often have the lights back on in hours, as opposed to days.</p>
    
                <p>Beyond maintaining control over their utilities, Wyandotte’s charm can be seen in many other examples. An often told (and possibly apocryphal) story states that at one point, Wyandotte was in the Guinness Book of World Records for two distinctions: the most bars per capita and the most churches per capita of any city in the world (if true, distinctions aided by its diminutive size as much as its ubiquity of places to drink or worship). The aforementioned Downtown District holds many charming shops and restaurants. In the summer months, the main street shuts down every “Third Friday” and downtown turns into a block party, where people gather to shop, eat, and enjoy special events like concerts. Every Fourth of July, Wyandotte holds a parade, which once held the distinction of being the largest in the state, that draws politicians, civic organizations, business, schools and other groups from around the country. While these occur on a scheduled basis, Wyandotte will find a reason to celebrate just about anything. When the local Merrill Lynch branch moved to a new location in town, they left a statue of a bull outside their old location. When they made plans to have the statue brought to its new home, the city threw an impromptu celebration called “The Moving of the Bull”, complete with the high school marching band. Who does that?! Wyandotte does that!</p>
    
                <p>Big or small, Wyandotte is a wonderful place to live and given the singularly focused citizenry, it is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future!</p>
